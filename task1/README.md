It is required to develop a code in JavaScript that prints to the console the largest number of lines passed, which are permutations of each other. If none of the strings is a permutation of the other (for example, only one string was passed, or the strings contain unique characters), print one of the strings. If no lines were passed, do not output anything. If there are several solutions, print one solution (any). The output is always followed by a line feed, each line is output on a separate line. Limitations (what will be checked does not need to be written into your code): the length of one line does not exceed 256 characters, the number of lines does not exceed 64, the lines contain only Latin letters and Arabic numbers, the execution time of one test is no more than 10 seconds, the output contains no extraneous characters. The decision will be made when passing the test suite, the result will be judged based on the file size in bytes (less is better). Please note that this is code golf, you need to compress the code into the minimum number of bytes.
